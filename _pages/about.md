Connecting geotechnical and geophysical data towards meaningful interpretation.

Hi there, I am Jason, currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the Disaster Prevention and Water Resources Center, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taiwan.

I am ...
- A full stack IoT researcher/developer with experience in Node-RED, nginx, MySQL, SQLite, Markdown, Python, MQTT, GitHub and eager to learn any to make life easier.
- Coding on Python, Matlab, Node-Red and Arduino C/C++.

I have ...
- Involved extensively with time-domain reflectometry (TDR) in slope monitoring, dielectric spectroscopy, geo-environmental monitoring and other exciting applications.
- Conducted 40++ geophysical exploration projects involving borehole logging, surface seismic, and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). 
- Deployed 30++ IoT monitoring stations in mountainous area all around Taiwan.
- Worked with code deployment on Windows, Ubuntu, Debian and Raspbian environment.
- Worked on both hardware-software interfacing and system integration from scratch.
- Deployed automated python scripts to analyze real-time monitoring/observation data and to bridge with messaging API.
- Designed 10++ PCB layouts specifically for IoT devices with easyEDA and KiCAD.

Currently interested in
- Smart slope monitoring with AIoT
- Connecting geotechnical and geophysical data towards meaningful interpretation with ML/DL.

Open to work and actively seeking for a tenure track position of assistant professor in Civil / Geotechnical Engineering.
