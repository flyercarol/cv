Work experience
======
- 2019 - current: Postdoctoral Researcher
  Disaster Prevention and Water Environment Research Centre (NYCU)
  National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University 
  - Lead over 30 near-surface geophysical surveys (surface seismic, ERT, TDR, borehole televiewer, and suspension P-S logging) in slope, dam and reservoir, LNG storage, nuclear power plant, airstrip, and contaminated site.
  - Deploy 15 slope monitoring stations and 10 reservoir SSC monitoring stations, which are based on low-powered Raspberry Pi SBC, TDR device, and in-house IoT modules (e.g. remote relay, power monitoring…).
  - Develop and optimize in-house automation software with Python, Kivy, and SQLite within the first 2 month.
  - Accelerated 21 project schedules up to 20% average and reduced 50% instrument cost via in-house modules.
  - Published 4 SCI-indexed, 4 EI-indexed and 6 conference papers over the past 3 years.
